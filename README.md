# Oauth Rails

Basic Oauth 2.1 compliant authorization server built with Rails.

Not really meant to be a production-ready server, but more of a way to learn about all of the aspects of the Oauth 2.0 authorization server role.

That said I do want to implement:

1. Client credentials flow
2. Code grant auth flow with support for the PKCE extension
  * Proof Key for Code Exchange
3. Persisted user records with access and refresh tokens 
4. FE to manage user records as an admin


...plus, other stuff...TBD
